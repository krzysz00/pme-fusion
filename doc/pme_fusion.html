<h1 class="file"><span style="float:right"></span>pme_fusion.pl -- Find fusable loop invariants from partitioned (matrix) expressions</h1>

<p>
This module contains the main algorithm for and interface to
partitioned-expression based fusion. The input format used by the
API is based on FLAME notation, but is not limited to linear
algebra.</p>

<p>
A series of fusable loop invariants consists of a loop invariant for
each operation in the algoritm that is to be fused. If an algorithm
for each operation is derived from that operation's loop invariant,
the fusability guarantees that the loop bodies of these algorithms
can be concatentated without issue.</p>

<p>
The system's inputs consists of a list of lists of tasks, which
represent the computations each operation being fused will need to
perform.</p>

<p>
It should be noted that each operation being fused is specified as
if it were the only operation being performed.</p>

<h1 class="wiki">Usage</h1>

<p>
The main interface to the API is <a href="pme_fusion.html#gen_invariants/1">gen_invariants/1</a> (and its relative
<a href="pme_fusion.html#gen_invariant/1">gen_invariant/1</a>). These functions take a list of lists of tasks or a
list of tasks, respectively. They find and print all (fusable) loop
invariants for the series of operations specified by the task lists.</p>

<p>
An alternate interfare is provided by
<a href="pme_fusion.html#fusion_constrained_system_for_tasks/2">fusion_constrained_system_for_tasks/2</a> and
<a href="pme_fusion.html#fused_invariants_for_system/3">fused_invariants_for_system/3</a>.
<code>fusion_constrained_system_for_tasks(Tasks, System)</code> returns a
<code>system</code> dictionary (described in more detail below) that, among other
things, includes the system of indicator variables and constraints
that indicate what partitions of a task list into a <code>past</code> and a
<code>future</code> are valid. The <code>system</code> value can be modified to enforce
additional constraints before the search, which is performed by
<a href="pme_fusion.html#fused_invariants_for_system/3">fused_invariants_for_system/3</a>. That function takes a <code>system</code>
dictionary and returns once for each valid split of the tasks that
created it into <var>Pasts</var> (a list of list of tasks in each loop's
invariant) and <var>Futures</var> (a list of lists tasks in each loop's
remainder). These lists can be passed to printing functions like
<a href="pme_fusion.html#print_task_lists/2">print_task_lists/2</a> or <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=print_task_lists_sep/2">print_task_lists_sep/2</a> (which adds a newline
after the lists, which is useful when mapping over the set of possible
results) in order to present them.</p>

<h1 class="wiki">Types and syntax</h1>

<p>
We well specify the input format for our API in a bottom-up matter.</p>

<p>
An <code>id</code> is an arbitrary atom representing a region in a FLAME-style
partitioning of an object. The algorithms whose loop invariants this
code generates operate by repeatedly repartitioning objects to move
their date between regions while maintaining the loop invariant.</p>

<p>
Any region (with ID <var>Id</var>) can be in one of several <code>base_state</code>s,
which represent the current contents of the region in memory.
A <code>base_state</code> can be one of the following terms</p>

<dl class="termlist">
<dt class="term"><b class="pred">hat</b><var class="arglist">(Id)</var></dt><dd>The initial state of a region at the beginning of an operation</dd>
<dt class="term"><b class="pred">tilde</b><var class="arglist">(Id)</var></dt><dd>The final state of a region, which occurs once that region has
been fully overwritten with the results of the operation.</dd>
<dt class="term"><b class="pred">during</b><var class="arglist">(Id, N)</var></dt><dd>The <var>N</var>th intermediate state of a region, representing partial
computation. States with a higher <var>N</var> value within the same
<var>Region</var> must come after those with lower values of <var>N</var>. <var>N</var> is
an integer.</dd>
<dt class="term"><b class="pred">during</b><var class="arglist">(Id, N, Alt)</var></dt><dd>An intermediate state, as above. The <var>Alt</var> parameter allows for
specifying groups of states that may be in any order relative to
each other. This feature, which is often combined with the <code>any</code>
state may be needed in cases such as representing $A = A - B -
C$, which we write as the two tasks <code>eq(during(a, 0, a),
sub(any([hat(a), during(a, 0, b)]), b))</code> and <code>eq(during(a, 0,
b), sub(any([hat(a), during(a, 0, a)]), c))</code>, which show that
the subtractions can be rearranged relative to each other.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A <code>state</code> is either a <code>base_state</code> or `any([BaseState, ...,])`, which is used when specifying several possible <code>base_state</code>s that a task can read from.
An <code>any</code> state cannot be used as the output of a task.</p>

<p>
An <code>input_term</code> is an arbitrary ground term (that is, an arbitrary collection of function symbols, lists, atoms, etc.) that may contain <code>state</code>s as subterms.
For example, <code>hat(a_tl)</code> is an <code>input_term</code>, as is <code>multiply(hat(a_tl), add(tilde(a_tr), hat(a_tl)))</code>, or <code>[cthulu(parrot), summon(any([hat(a_tl), during(a_tl, 0, a)]))]</code>.
The invariant finder only considers the extracted <code>state</code>s for the purposes of invariant finding.
However, the ability to use arbitrary terms to describe the inputs allows for more human-readable task lists (and output).</p>

<p>
A <code>task</code> is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>eq(BaseState, InputTerm)</code>
This is a task that writes out <var>BaseState</var> by performing the
computations in <var>InputTerm</var>. The <code>state</code>s in <var>InputTerm</var> and
<var>BaseState</var> are used to track dependencies between tasks.</li>
<li><code>op_eq(BaseState, InputTerm)</code>
This is the same as <code>eq(BaseState, InputTerm)</code>, except that it
signifies that the task represents the operation that loop
invariants are being sought for.

<p>
For example, in a task list for a lower-tirangular solve, we would
need to write <code>op_eq(tilde(x_t), solve(l_tl, b_t))</code> but
<code>eq(during(x_b, 0), sub(hat(x_b), mul(l_bl, tilde(x_t))))</code>, since
the second operation is not a lower-triangular solve. Using
<code>op_eq</code> is important, as it is used to ensure that the generated
loops are capable of making progress towards computing an
operation.</p></li>
<li><code>comes_from(OutBaseState, InputTerm)</code> This is a special task used
when the expression InputTerm also necessarily entails the
computation of OutBaseState. purpose of this task is to connect
the computation of the two states so that one cannot remain
uncomputed while the other has been. This is useful in cases such
as the LU factorization, where the tasks that generate <code>l_tl</code> also
compute <code>u_tl</code>.</li>
<li><code>const(BaseState)</code> This is a task that is generally automatically
created, which represents a region that is a pure input - that is,
one that is not ever updated by the algorithm. The purpose of this
tasks is to allow maintaining a consistent direction of iteration
when ensuring that requires analyzing such inputs. These tasks
follow the typical fusion analysis, and have the additional
restriction that they cannot be in the loop invariant unless one
of the tasks that depends on them is.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>system</code> dictionary returned by
<a href="pme_fusion.html#fusion_constrained_system_for_tasks/2">fusion_constrained_system_for_tasks/2</a> has the following four fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>tasks This contains the list of lists of tasks that generated the
system, with const tasks included</li>
<li>indicators A list of <code>assoc</code> structures, one per loop. The keys to
these lists are the outputs of each task in that loop, while the
values are variables with <code>clpfd</code> constrains applied and domain
`0..1`. Having an indicator set to <code>1</code> indicates that the task
with the associated output is in the loop invariant, <code>0</code> indicates
it is in the remainder.</li>
<li>computed An <code>assoc</code> where the keys are regions (not states) that
appear in the fusion problem with values whose domains are `-1..N
<ul>
<li>1` (where <var>N</var> is the number of loops being fused). The values
represent the index of the last loop in a fusion problem where the
associated region is fully computed. These variables are not
searched, but do participate in constraints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>uncomputed Like <code>computed</code>, except that each variable represents
the index of the first loop where the associated region is
uncomputed, and the variables have domain `0..N`.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is safe to apply additional constraints to any of these variables before calling
<a href="pme_fusion.html#fused_invariants_for_system/3">fused_invariants_for_system/3</a>.</p>
