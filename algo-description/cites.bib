abstract = {In this paper we present a systematic approach to the derivation of families of high-performance algorithms for a large set of frequently encountered dense linear algebra operations. As part of the derivation a constructive proof of the correctness of the algorithm is given. The paper is structured so that it can be used as a tutorial for novices. However, the method has been shown to yield new, high-performance algorithms for well-studied linear algebra operations and should also be of interest to the "high priests of high performance."},
